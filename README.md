## rocsys-EasyCAT

The EasyCAT shield board converts an Arduino as an EtherCAT slave. This is low cost solution to synchronize simple sensors with other devices with much elaborated communication protocols. In addition it allows multiple Arduinos to be connected in series (daisy-chained) thus increasing the possibility of interacting with more sensors/setups.

The libraries and configuration gui for the EasyCAT shield board are better organized in this repository for easy testing.
